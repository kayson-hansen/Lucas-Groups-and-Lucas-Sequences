We study Lucas Sequences, recursive sequences that generalize the Fibonacci Sequence, and Lucas Groups,
solutions of a variant of Pells Equation mod p. Lucas Sequences have a broad background in the literature,
but Lucas Groups have seldom been studied before. When taken mod some prime p, Lucas Sequences form
a cyclic group, which will be a subgroup of the corresponding Lucas Group. We show exactly when these
two groups are isomorphic by relating a constant associated with the Lucas Sequence and primitive roots of
the field with p elements. Furthermore, we prove how often this isomorphism occurs for each prime p > 3.
We also give a computationally efficient method to find the index of the Lucas Sequence in the Lucas Group
when they are not isomorphic.
